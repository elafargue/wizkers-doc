#Building Wizkers

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for building (and running Wizkers in server mode) are NodeJS and npm.

You will need to install a recent 0.10 version of NodeJS â€“ Wizkers is not tested on Node 0.12 yet. You can refer to [this guide](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) for details on how to do this on Linux, in particular.
### Platform-specific prerequisites

#### MacOS

You should be able to install all the building prerequisites on MacOS by simply visiting the [Nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) side and download NodeJS version 10.X.

#### Beaglebone Black on Linux

Assuming you are starting with a brand new BeagleBone Black, you have a choice of operating systems. At the moment (August 2015), the BBB team seems to favour Debian as the official distribution, so this is what we will use. Installation of the OS image is beyond the scope of this guide, but you can find more information about this at [Beagleboard.org](http://beagleboard.org/latest-images).

The reference image used in the build instructions below is `Base Image: BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.8-console-armhf-2015-03-01-2gb`

Once your BBB has booted up, you will need to install the basic development toolchains, as well as NodeJS and git:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install --yes ntpdate
sudo ntpdate -b -s -u pool.ntp.org
sudo apt-get install --yes build-essential
sudo apt-get install --yes curl
curl --insecure --location https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.10 | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install --yes nodejs
sudo apt-get install --yes git
```

You can then move on to checking out the code, as described in the next section.

#### Generic Linux

Linux instructions are very similar to the Beaglebone black instructions described above. The only difference from one distribution to the next is the presence of a bundled NodeJS with the distribution: if you have access to Node version 0.10 or later as part of your distributions's package manager, you should definitely try it before doing a manual download and install.

#### Windows

While there is no good reason why building Wizkers on Windows shouldn't work, I have never attempted it. If you would like to contribute instructions, please reach out at [info@wizkers.io](mailto:info@wizkers.io).

## Check out the code

Wizkers is hosted on [github](https://github.com/wizkers/wizkers). Create a work directory on your machine and check out the code from Github, and go to the 'release' branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wizkers/wizkers.git
cd wizkers/server
git checkout release
```

## Build it

Wizkers supports the [Helium](http://www.helium.com/) IoT network for some of its instruments. The NodeJS "nodhelium" module requires installing "libhelium" on your system. If you don't have any idea what Helium is about, you definitely don't need it, and you can edit out the two locations on Wizkers which depend on libhelium:

* server/package.json
* server/connectionmanager.js (line 45)

The next step is to install all dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This can take from a couple of minutes to quite some time if you are building on a low power system such as a Beaglebone.

Once all dependencies are installed, Wizkers uses 'gulp' as its build system: if gulp is not installed on your system already, use npm to get it:

```bash
sudo npm install -g gulp
```

You can now build Wizkers in its three supported modes:

```bash
gulp chrome
gulp cordova
gulp android
```

Those three gulp targets will build Wizkers in the `dist` directory

## Finalizing and packaging

Once the base code is built through Gulp, the instructions below will show you how to finalize the build for the various run modes and launch Wizkers:

### Chrome app

After building, the Chrome version of Wizkers will be ready in `dist/chrome` and `dist/chrome-debug`. The `chrome-debug` directory can be immediately loaded into Google Chrome by visiting (chrome://extensions) and loading Wizkers from there.

The `chrome` version requires finalizing the compilation by launching `build-toold/build-chrome.sh` which will optimize the javascript code. The resulting Chrome app in `dist/chrome` will run faster but it won't be possible to debug it easily.

### Cordova (Android app)

The Android app version of Wizker uses the Cordova framework to package Wizkers into a native Android application.


### Server

The server build of Wizkers is available in `dist/server`. Simply go to that directory and launch the server:

```bash
cd dist/server
node server.js
```
