# Medcom Onyx

The Onyx is a state of the art Geiger counter, based on an Open Source design by [Bunnie Huang](http://bunniestudios.org/). What puts it apart from other open source Geiger counter designs, is that the Onyx is built, calibrated and supported by [International Medcom](http://medcom.com/), one of the most respected names in the nuclear detection industry.

Wizkers is the official utility for the Medcom Onxy and is guaranteed to support all its capabilities.

Wizkers displays the current and historical radiation graph on the main screen, can record the output of the Onyx at any rate, and regularly upload radioactivity values to backend services, including Safecast. Wizkers also support configuring the Onyx, remote calibrations as well as device log data downloads.

Last, it also lets you update the firmware of the Onyx.

## The main screen

The main screen of Wizkers when connected to an Onyx is similar to what you will see with most other supported Geiger Counters:

The main graph displays instant CPM readings (in orange) as well as a rolling 10 minute average (in dark brown). The side display shows the current CPM and ÂµSv/h readings, as well as a "valid/invalid" pill which reflects the status of the Onyx.

## Device Setup

Since Wizkers provides official support to Medcom for the Onyx, nearly all the capabilities of this device are supported in the Device Setup screen

The Onyx can store 3000+ recordings in its flash memory. You can download the logs from the "logs and recordings" screen. Wizkers supports all Onyx log formats, including single datapoint logs, and min/max logs.

## Log display and download

The "Logs and recordings" screen lets you visualize both Wizkers recordings and downloaded device logs.
